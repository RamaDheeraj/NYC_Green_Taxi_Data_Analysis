NYC Green Taxi data analysis and Tip Prediction

I have collected the data by the New York City Taxi and Limousine commission about "Green" Taxis.
Green Taxis (as opposed to yellow ones) are taxis that are not allowed to pick up passengers inside of the densely populated 
areas of Manhattan.

I have used September 2015 data for analysis.

Data Available at http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml
